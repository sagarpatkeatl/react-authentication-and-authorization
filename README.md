# Implementing Authentication and Authorization with ReactJS

This repository provides starter code to practice implementation of Authentication
and Authorization with ReactJS. The server side of the code is implemented, so that
you can practise the client-side implementation for the same.

Authentication can be implemented in one of two ways:
1. Session based authentication
1. Session-less / Token based authentication

Session based authentication worked well together with MVC Architecture, and is
widely in use even today. However, this implementation provides a token based
authentication. It is mostly implemented for securing APIs and can also be used for
SPAs and Native Android and iOS apps.
